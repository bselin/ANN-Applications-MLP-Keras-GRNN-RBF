# ANN-Applications-MLP-Keras-GRNN-RBF
MLP with Keras framework, GRNN and RBF. 

In this notebook, I applied different ANN algorithms: MLP with Keras framework, GRNN and RBF. I took some notes that I consider important. This is a part of my undergraduate thesis project. Dataset is used for forecasting of traffic density in Ä°stanbul.
